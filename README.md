# ReState - A Simple Property Viewing App

## Introduction  
ReState is a mobile app built with React Native that allows users to explore various properties. The app fetches property data from AppWrite and displays them in an organized way. It includes a seeding function to generate dummy property listings for testing purposes.

## Why This App?  
I am learning React Native, and I wanted to build a simple yet functional app to understand the core concepts. This project helps me practice data fetching, navigation, and UI design while working with AppWrite as a backend service.

## Functionalities  
- Fetches property data from AppWrite  
- Includes a seeding function to add dummy data  
- Allows users to browse properties and view details  
- Property management, booking, and favorites are not implemented yet
